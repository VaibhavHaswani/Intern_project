For the given project I have used 
Python with Flask (a web-development framework with jinja templating scheme) for backened.
And there's a low key frontend as I haven't given much focus to it.
I hope the scenario requirements and given contraints are fulfilled.

		>Open cmd/ps on the project path
		>type in cmd: "venv\Scripts\activate"
2) Open server.py with any code editor
3) Change the values for admin_email,admin_pass,client_email
4) in cmd type :
